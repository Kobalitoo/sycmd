‚ö° Usage
Basic Command Example
After including the library, you can start defining commands like this:

pawn
Copiar c√≥digo
synCommand(help, playerid, params[]) {
    SendClientMessage(playerid, 0xFFFF00FF, "This is the help command!");
    return 1;
}
Command with Admin Permissions
To restrict a command to admins only:

pawn
Copiar c√≥digo
synCommand(adminOnlyCommand, playerid, params[]) {
    if (!IS_ADMIN(playerid)) {
        SendClientMessage(playerid, COLOR_RED, "You don't have permission to use this command.");
        return 0;
    }
    
    SendClientMessage(playerid, COLOR_GREEN, "Admin command executed successfully.");
    return 1;
}
Command with Multiple Arguments
Commands can also accept multiple arguments:

pawn
Copiar c√≥digo
synCommand(testArgsCommand, playerid, params[]) {
    SendClientMessage(playerid, COLOR_GREEN, "Command with multiple arguments executed!");
    return 1;
}
Advanced Logging (Optional)
You can implement logging of executed commands:

pawn
Copiar c√≥digo
public logCommand(playerid, cmdtext[], success)
{
    format(logBuffer[playerid], sizeof(logBuffer[playerid]), "Player %d executed the command: %s. Success: %d", playerid, cmdtext, success);
    printf(logBuffer[playerid]); // Print log to server console
}
